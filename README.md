# Pet shelter revamped

View live version of the website [here](placeholder).

This website is a revamped version of [my original first milestone project](https://github.com/Larkinz/pet-shelter-project) for the Code Institute course.

This revamp was mainly done to test my improvements in HTML, CSS, and UI/UX design.
