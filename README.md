# Pet shelter revamped

View live version of the website [here](https://pet-shelter-revamped-9ae12c6ada43.herokuapp.com/).

This website is a revamped version of [my original first milestone project](https://github.com/Larkinz/pet-shelter-project) for the Code Institute course.

This revamp was mainly done to test my improvements in HTML, CSS, and UI/UX design.

## User experience design (UXD)

### Strategy

#### Goal

#### User stories

### Scope

#### Functional specifications

#### Content requirements

### Structure

#### Information architecture

#### Interaction design

### Skeleton

#### Wireframes

I've made a rough wireframe just to have a visual reminder of the new layout for the main page. To see the wireframe click [here](wireframes/main_layout.png).

### Surface

#### Colours

Improving on the previous colour scheme was necessary for better colour contrast. I've picked colours from the [Tailwind CSS colour palette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors), making sure for the dark and light colours to have the required minimum contrast score of 4.5 using the [Coolors contrast checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/fffbeb-15803d).

The main colours I've chosen are: Green 700, Amber 50, and Blue 950.
