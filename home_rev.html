            <p class="hero-description">At Blackbrook pet shelter we specialize in the rescue and rehoming of both dogs and cats. Upon arrival, we take good care of them immediately and we try our best to find them suitable new owners. We have very experienced employees that provide lots of love and care to our animals. Our goal is to provide pets with a temporary safe place to stay until they get matched with a new best friend. Since 1992 we have successfully found new loving homes for an estimated 2781 pets in the Blackbrook region. Whether you need to let go of a pet or you're interested in adopting, we've got you covered!</p>

            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">History</h3>
            <p>In August of 1992, we opened the doors to our new pet shelter located at 24 Southend Avenue in Blackbrook. Since our opening in 1992 we have successfully found new loving homes for an estimated 2781 pets in the Blackbrook region. We don't choose the animals that we serve and care for, they choose us! Every year we take in over 85 homeless animals. They are the strays, the abandoned, the abused and the neglected from all parts of the Blackbrook region. We give them the love and the care that they need while they are with us, and work hard to find them loving forever homes.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Our mission</h3>
            <p>It is our mission to reduce animal homelessness and pet overpopulation by caring for and sheltering homeless animals, providing education to the public about responsible ownership, practicing vetted and thorough adoption services, and advocating spay & neuter programs. The blackbrook pet shelter is a no kill shelter in that we euthanize only non-rehabilitatable pets who are irremediably suffering or dangerous to people or other pets. The Shelter only considers euthanasia as an absolute last resort where no other avenue is open to prevent a danger to the public, other animals, or pain and suffering of the animal.</p>
